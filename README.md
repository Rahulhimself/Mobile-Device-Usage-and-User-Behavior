# Mobile-Device-Usage-and-User-Behavior

## This Power BI dashboard provides a detailed analysis of user behavior across different mobile operating systems, demographics, and usage patterns.
<hr>

## Dashboard Objective

### -To compare usage and resource consumption (data usage and battery drain) between Android and iOS user bases.

### To identify user segments (by Age and Gender) driving the highest Screen Time and Data Usage.

### To correlate the number of installed applications with daily data consumption.
<hr>

## Key Data Points & Metrics

### Sum of Data Usage (MB/day): Total data consumed, broken down by Operating System (OS).

### Sum of Screen On Time (hours/day): Total accumulated screen time, segmented by Age group.

### Battery Drain in Different Devices (K): A comparison of resource consumption across top device models (e.g., iPhone 12, Xiaomi Mi 11).

### User Behavior Class: A slicer for segmenting users by pre-defined behavioral cohorts.

## Core Insights & Findings

### OS Dominance: Android users account for the majority of the data usage (78.34% of the total volume).

### Power Users: Users with a high number of installed apps (specifically 80–100 apps) are the most significant data consumers across both platforms.

### Peak Screen Time: The highest total screen time is seen in the 20s and 30s age groups, with another high point in the 50s age group.

### Android Profile: The analyzed sample showed a demographic skew toward Male (75%) Android users, with the highest screen time observed in the 50–55 age range.

### iOS Profile: iOS users in the sample show a more balanced Gender split and peak screen time in the 55–60 age group.
